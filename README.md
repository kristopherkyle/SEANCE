This tool was conceptualized by Scott Crossley and Kristopher Kyle and implemented in Python by Kristopher Kyle.

# Quick Start Guide
For Mac OSX, download the SEANCE_1_2_0_Mac.zip file (found under the "releases" tab). After extracting the SEANCE program from the .zip file, double-click the icon to open the program. Note that you may have to change your security preferences to open SEANCE.
For Windows 7, 8, and 10 (64-bit versions only), download the SEANCE_1_2_0_win.zip file (found under the "releases" tab). After extracting the SEANCE program from the .zip file, double-click the icon to open the program.
Note that after clicking on the SEANCE icon, a terminal (Mac) or command prompt (Windows) window will open. SEANCE will take 10-20 seconds to initialize, depending on the speed of your program.
